# E-Share Donation Platform

This platform operates on the principles of a sharing economy, enabling short-term peer-to-peer transactions that facilitate collaboration through the sharing of equipment, ideas, access, and services. Promoting a culture of sharing encourages a more collaborative and sustainable approach to resource utilization.
## How is our platform work:
Our donation website platform functions as a peer-to-peer online marketplace, akin to popular platforms like Airbnb and Uber. It connects people who wish to donate new, unused, or used equipment with those in need, using a semi-automatic system that streamlines the process.
